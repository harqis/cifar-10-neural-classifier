# cifar-10-neural-classifier
Image classifier using TensorFlow for CIFAR-10 dataset.

The CIFAR-10 is an image dataset consisting of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The classifier utilizes TensorFlow to achieve classifying accuracy of ~70 %.
More layers could be added to the model for even better accuracy, but this is not implemented because my computer is not powerful enough for more complex modelling.
